The controls for the game are the joysticks for movement and aiming, right bumper for shooting and left bumper for dashing. 


The mechanic we have added is a movement dash.
	It is mainly used to dodge over the deadly lava gaps in our level. If you dash through an enemy it kills them. Our intention is to make it both a movement tool and a combat tool for the player to utilize. 

The main goal of the game is to survive. Shooting enemies spawn endlessly and at increasing frequency.
